Body: Cringly:

> What's important to you in the development of a product?

Steve Jobs:

> One of the things that really hurt Apple was after I left, John Scully got a very serious disease.

> And that disease — I've seen other people get it too — it's the disease of thinking that really great idea is 90% of the work.

> And that if you just tell all these other people, you know, "Here's this great idea," then of course they can go off and make it happen.

> And the problem with that is, is that there is just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship in between a great idea and a great product.

> And as you evolve that great idea, it changes and grows.

> It never comes out like it starts, because you learn a lot more as you get into the subtleties of it and you also find there is tremendous trade-offs that you have to make.

> I mean, there are just certain things you can't make electrons do. There are certain things you can't make plastics do or glass do or factories do or robots do.

> And as you get into all these things, designing a product is keeping 5000 things in your brain — these concepts — and fitting them all together and kind of continuing to push to fit them together in new and different ways to get what you want.

> And ever day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together and a little differently.

> And it's that process that is the magic.
