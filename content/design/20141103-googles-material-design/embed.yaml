Body: I'm really excited for Google's new design language. One glaring annoyance that's bugged me since I got [my first Android](/p/7yebs2) is the design inconsistency of the icons. Another thing that's bugged me is the default Halo theme that feels so cold and lifeless.

Material Design on the other hand looks fun, playful and full of personality. It looks like a joy to use, much like my beloved (and iOS-exclusive) Tweetbot app.

Android fans have always boasted how Android is open. But when it was completely open, Android's lack of design guidance resulted in a chaotic mess of garbage apps that showed very little unity or consistency.

From a user experience standpoint, I'm really glad Google is tightening ship and leading the way for the Android developer community. Google's designers are fantastic and I hope all Android users upgrade to Lollipop soon.
