> The most striking lesson I have learned is that timeframes that seem absurdly bloated beforehand tend to look reasonable, even respectable, at the end of a project. Countless times over the course of my career, my colleagues and I have agreed that a project couldn't possibly take more than, say, three months. Then it ends up taking nine months or twelve months or more (sometimes much more). But looking back, with all the details and pitfalls and tangents in plain sight, you can see that that the initial estimate was hopelessly unrealistic. If anything, racing to meet it only served to slow the project down.

> The corollary is that the market rarely moves as fast as you expect. With rare exceptions, if you create something with a solid foundation that is usable, maintainable and meets a real need, it will be as relevant when you finally bring it to market as it was when you came up with the idea, even if it took you much longer than you anticipated. In my experience, **projects fail far more often because the software never really works reliably than because they miss a tight market window**. [...]

> We need to recognize that our job isn't about producing more code in less time, **it's about creating software that is stable, performant, maintainable and understandable** (to you or someone else, a few months or years down the road).

YES. A big fat resounding YES.

And the hardest part, in my experience, is getting the (non-programming) higher-ups to understand this. Too many times I've been ordered to shave corners on the under-the-hood stuff, only to have the entire house of cards come falling down later on.
