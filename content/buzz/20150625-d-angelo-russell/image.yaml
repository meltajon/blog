Ever since the Lakers [won the #2 draft pick](/p/doptqk), I've been researching non-stop and debating back-and-forth between Jahlil Okafor and D'Angelo Russell.

Both are going to be brilliant on offense, and both will equally have to improve their defense. But after watching a few interviews, I realized Russell has something that Okafor and Towns don't really have â€” that cockiness and competitive fire that says, *"I am the best damn player in this room and I will fucking prove it to you all."*

That's the stuff that separates the really good players from the *great* players.

MJ has it.  Kobe has it. LeBron has it. I think D'Angelo has it too.

So this morning, [I called it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/melmyfinger/status/614097036305010688). Low and behold, I was right.

Welcome to Los Angeles, D'Angelo!!
