	This is about a guy who is traveling Europe by train and meets a girl on his last day. After an interlude in the lounge car together he talks her into spending the rest of the night walking Vienna with him before his plane the next day. The rest of the movie is just about them talking as they travel through Vienna. Sounds ridiculously boring right?

<p>Yep, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112471/" title="IMDB: Before Sunrise">Before Sunrise</a> sounds like another stereotypical chick flick.  But since this Pete gave this a <a href="http://www.properscoundrels.com/?p=605" title="Film Review: Before Sunrise">glowing review</a>, I figured I'd check it out for myself.</p>

<p>The movie did not disappoint.</p>

<p>The style of the movie was done in a way that was simple, minimalist, and forces you to focus on one thing -- the dialogue.  And that's a <em>really</em> good thing because the stuff they talk about is so timeless yet so refreshing.  I love the dialogue so much, I've watched the movie four times already.  And every time I do it, I learn something new.</p>

<p>Instant favorite.  And the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381681/" title="IMDB: Before Sunset">sequel</a> is great too.</p>
