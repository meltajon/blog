Body: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.friendster.com/join.jsp?invite=400342"><img border="0" src="http://www.hotmel.com/images/news_pics/friendster.gif" /></a>yo everyone. this site is the newest thing to do online and i figured i should let you guys hear about it. its based on that 6 Degrees of Seperation Theory where everyone knows everyone on the world within 6 people.

what you do is you post up your profile (and other stuff like your marital status, interests...blah blah) and then you can <em>Add Friends</em> to your little list...once you've done that you can see who are your friends' friends' friends'...etc. its a pretty cool idea and i figured you guys would hear about this eventually...so there...you heard it from me first.

this shit is really fuckin' crazy...for example my roommate's girlfriend is connected to my cousin's girlfriend...and this one girl, phoebe, is connected to my webb friends...crazy shit...i've been looking at this all fucking day.

anyways, click the pic to signup and be added to my friends list.

ps.  the site is really overloaded due to popularity, so keep trying even thought the site might not always be online...
