> Last week was hellish. The unconscionable Boston Marathon bombings on Monday were followed on Thursday night by a rampage through Cambridge and Watertown, and a full-day lockdown of the area. Ultimately, one suspect was killed while a second was captured alive on Friday night. Now we must attempt to return to some semblance of normalcy.

> 

> And so it was that on Saturday, the Boston Red Sox returned to Fenway Park for their first home game since the bombings. A very moving ceremony was held prior to the first pitch to memorialize the victims and honor many of those who aided the wounded and eventually caught the perpetrators. As it was wrapping up, David Ortiz took the field for the first time in 2013. He gave a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6JDF1Prrqk">brief speech</a>, one which was both impactful and explicit:

> 

> > This jersey that we wear today doesn't say "Red Sox". It says "Boston""¦This is our _fucking_ city! And nobody's gonna dictate our freedoms. Stay strong!

> 

> Frankly, though the park was full of children and the game was airing live on TV, it was exactly what needed to be said. After seeing pictures of bloodied victims missing limbs, we can cope with a little salty language. The crowd, roaring in appreciation, certainly agreed. Watching at home, I laughed and clapped along with them, but I also wondered what might happen as a result. The FCC doesn't generally take kindly to expletives being broadcast on television.

> 

> An answer came shortly, via a tweet from FCC chairman, and Boston-area native, Julius Genachowski:

> 

> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>David Ortiz spoke from the heart at today's Red Sox game. I stand with Big Papi and the people of Boston - Julius</p>— The FCC (@FCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/FCC/status/325714412143013888">April 20, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

> 

> Fuck yeah.
