> I began to wonder what other authors thought of the [Oxford Comma](https://twitter.com/CelebrityOxford). I created a Twitter handle named Celebrity Oxford Comma and began to ask away.

> I started off slowly, first targeting just authors. As it turns out, I’m not familiar with a lot of authors. So I expanded. Asking actors, musicians, athletes, and people of note. Each time I would tweet the same message: Super important question: Where do you stand on the use of the Oxford Comma?

> I wasn’t expecting much of a response. The fact is, I thought this was a little silly. *Who is going to take the time to respond to me?* Well, it took a little bit, but then it started.

The Oxford Comma is one of those things that nobody talks about, and I've *always* felt I was in the minority when it came to using it. Seeing this list of celebrity writers, authors, and actors that also use the Oxford Comma makes me happy.
