[Mike Trudell](http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/150519lottery_two):

> There was only an 11.9 percent chance that the Lakers would get the second pick, but team representative, coach and former Laker himself Byron Scott was more than happy to see his team grab the pick that will be L.A.'s highest since James Worthy went No. 1 in 1982.
> 
> There was a better chance that L.A. would lose its selection to Philadelphia (via Phoenix in the Steve Nash trade) by having two teams jump into the top three ahead of them, but it wasn't that kind of night for the Lakers.

There was only one team to jump up in draft position -- the Lakers.

The Basketball Gods smile upon the city of Los Angeles!
