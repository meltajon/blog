In anticipation of the first-gen Apple Watch being released later this month, here are [some comments on the original iPhone](https://web.archive.org/web/20080418003110/http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-apple-iphone/#comments) back in 2007:

<blockquote>
	<p>the iphone is announced to appear in 2007 , the n95 from nokia which is a 2006 model cand kick iphone's arse very easily, the iphone is just some sort of eye candy, i have a 6680 and i would'n trade it for iphone:)</p>
	<p>try comparing the iphone with the n95 on gsm arena, you will be surprised.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<p>Apparently none of you guys realize how bad of an idea a touch-screen is on a phone. I foresee some pretty obvious and pretty major problems here.</p>
	<p>I'll be keeping my Samsung A707, thanks. It's smaller, it's got a protected screen, and it's got proper buttons. And it's got all the same features otherwise. (Oh, but it doesn't run a bloatware OS that was never designed for a phone.)</p>
	<p>Color me massively disappointed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<p>Im not impressed with the iPhone. As a PDA user and a Windows Mobile user, this thing has nothing on my phone. It sure is good at what it was designed for, a phone that entertains and talks... other than that, i dont see much potential. How the hell am I suppose to put appointments on the phone with no stylus or keyboard?! I can sync it with my computer, but when Im on the go, I cant do either!</p>
	<p>No thanks Apple. Make a real PDA please....</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<p>lol last i checked many companies tried the tap to type and tap to dial ... IT DOESNT WORK STEVIE, people dont like non-tactile typing, its a simple fact, this isnt a phone its a mac pda wow yippie.... </p>
	<p>I mean it looks pretty but its not something i forsee being the next ipod for the phone industry...</p>
	<p>and its funny how people are "orgasming" when you havent even seen it being used or a real presentation of it just a mockup graphic on the screen, yes its thinner than the q and the samsung, guess what those were 2006 phones, this is a 2007 apple phone, what did samsung and motorola stop developing last month or something? </p>
	<p>It took apple how long to develop this ONE PHONE, samsung and motorola release new phones every few months lol, and constantly innovates and gets better, im sorry but if im sending text messages i'd rather have my thumb keyboard than some weird finger tapping on a screen crap.</p>

Typical short-sighted reactions by consumers who are driven by tech specs, feature lists, "but other companies did it first," and think design is about "how it looks."
