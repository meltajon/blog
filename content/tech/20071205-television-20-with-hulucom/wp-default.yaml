<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.melmyfinger.com/archive/2007/01/02/how-i-spent-my-year-2006/">my Tivo</a> got the award for my best purchase of the year.  But soon, I may get rid of her for someone new.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu.com</a> is a site pioneered by NBC Studios, that offers a shitload of free, good quality streaming television shows from its own network and many, many others.</p>

<p>The site is in beta testing and I was fortunate enough to get my hands on an invite.  And I gotta say, I'm impressed.  Here's a sample of shows they have:</p>

<ul>

	<li>24</li>

	<li>30 Rock</li>

	<li>Arrested Development</li>

	<li>Chuck</li>

	<li>Doogie Howser</li>

	<li>Family Guy</li>

	<li>Heroes</li>

	<li>Scrubs</li>

	<li>The Simpsons</li>

	<li>and a whole lot more...</li>

</ul>

<p>Here's a couple screenshots:</p>

<p>Yes, all of this for free.  The catch?  The occassional 30 second advertisement.  Still, that beats the current 2:30 minute commercial spots they show on live television.  And besides, what are your alternatives?</p>

<p>Tivo?  Works great til you find two interesting shows that are playing at the same time.</p>

<p>Tv-Links.com?  Was awesome til the place was raided by police.</p>

<p>Download from torrent sites?  <s>I'm too busy downloading p...</s> I'm too impatient for that.</p>

<p>Buy from iTunes?  Hell no.  As much as I love Apple, I'm not gonna give them my money for meh-quality, copy protected videos.</p>

<p>So anyways, like I said, Hulu.com is still in beta.  But definitely sign up for an invite when you get the chance.</p>
