> I like that Apple is seemingly being thoughtful, measured, and realistic in this roll out. This SDK makes it clear that Apple will not be promising the world with the v1 of Apple Watch. Instead, we’re likely to get something much more akin to the first version of the iPhone. As you’ll recall, that initial device, while magical, only ran apps produced by Apple. Third party developers were required to use the web to reach users on the device. Apple is clearly being more lenient here — but not that much more lenient. The only apps that will run natively on Apple Watch to start will be made by Apple.

Slow and steady is the way to go. We've seen Apple do this time and time again, with the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.

In a decade we'll see the Apple Watch will grow into the most important device for mainstream consumers, akin to what the smartphone is for people today. Until then, Apple will take their time to do it right, adding the right features as the necessary technology becomes technically and financially feasible.

In the meantime, Samsung has rushed out their sixth version of their smartwatch line in one year, all of which have been flops. Because apparently, at Samsung, quantity and doing things first is more important than doing it right.
