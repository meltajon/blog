Body: <p>For the longest time, I used my blog as my personal diary (saving my diary posts as private, of course).</p>

<p>And then I started to get lazy and just wrote everything on an endless, totally insecure, text file. I would tell myself, "at the end of the month, I will paste my entries onto my blog."</p>

<p>Two things sucked about this process:</p>

<ol>
<li>There were a couple times when I accidentally published a diary post as public.</li>
<li>For a solid 2 years, I stopped moving my diary entries from the text file to my blog.</li>
</ol>

<p>When <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/momento-diary-journal/id347019672?mt=8" title="Day One app for iPhone">Day One</a> for iOS/OSX came out, I debated for weeks on whether it was worth the money. Ever since I bought it, I've wished I had this thing 10 years ago.</p>

<p>One thing I love about Day One is its more in-tune with my journaling habits:</p>

<ul>
<li>I tend to write diary entries in short, tweet-like bullet points.</li>
<li>Lots of times I want to write something private on the spot, not when I get home.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now, with today's update, Day One supports photos and Foursquare places.</p>

<p>Photos is a really, really awesome feature because a photo really is worth a thousand words. And sometimes all you really need for a diary entry is a good photo of that precious moment. As a bonus, when you attach a photo to Day One, it'll automagically time- and geo-stamp the information to that diary entry. I just added a photo from this past weekend of my friend dancing with his mom at his wedding, and BAM, Day One already sets the date, time and location for it</p>

<p>If there's one thing I wish Day One had, it would be the importing of all my social networking activities. I still have this iPhone app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/momento-diary-journal/id347019672?mt=8" title="Momento: Diary/Journal app for iPhone">Momento</a> which imports data from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Foursquare and more...but the developers of Momento don't show nearly as much dedication as the Day One guys.</p>
