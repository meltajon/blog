Out of all the Apple Watch reviews that came out today, only one person brought this up. [Ben Bajarin](https://techpinions.com/my-first-week-with-the-apple-watch/39543):

> Primarily around the notification and glance-able data experience, I saw a behavioral shift in how I used my iPhone. **In many ways the Apple Watch untethered me from my iPhone the way the iPhone untethered me from my PC.** I was free to leave my phone somewhere in the house, at my desk, or in my pocket, and focus more on the moments of real life. Sometimes it was a meeting, at home, out in my yard, at the kidâ€™s tennis match, etc. There was peace of mind knowing I can leave my phone out of sight or mind but still have access to the relevant information or notifications and even be able to interact and respond to them. The most important interactions and information are no longer only accessible on my large screen smartphone. This experience, of moving key functionality from my iPhone to my wrist, proved to add a significant amount of value to my overall day.

Smartphones are known as digital leashes. Our phones are always within an arm's reach, constantly begging us to pick up, play with, and distract us from the things that matter. All of the other reviews talked about the Apple Watch giving you less reason to reach into your pocket for your phone but Ben Bajarin is the only person to talk about how much more freedom you'll have at home with your family, just by leaving your phone at his desk.

Cooking dinner for the family. Spending quality time with your kids. Having playtime with your dog. Gardening in the front yard. Shooting hoops in the backyard. Working out in the garage.

When you're at home, you should feel *at home*; you shouldn't have to feel obligated to stay leashed to the world through your phone. With a smartwatch, as long as you set up the your notifications right, you'll be given back some more of your time, as well as your freedom, to enjoy the things that actually matter.
