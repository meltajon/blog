Thanks to [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/12/30/android-profits) for pointing out [this gem](http://www.businessinsider.com/android-iphone-market-share-2011-4) from April 2011:

> Importantly, it's not a question of which platform [Android or iPhone] is "better." (This is irrelevant.) It's a question of which platform everyone else uses.  And increasingly, in the smartphone market, barring a radical change in trend, that's Android.

> So that's why Android's gains matter. And, yes, Apple fans should be scared to death about them.

Fast forward 3.5 years to today. [Re/code](http://recode.net/2014/12/30/android-hardware-profits-tanked-in-2014-as-xiaomi-gains-failed-to-offset-samsung-sony-losses/):

> While Android continued to gain market share in the global smartphone market, it saw a significant drop on another key metric: Profits.

> Analyst Chetan Sharma estimates that global profits in the Android hardware market for 2014 were down by half from the prior year — the first year that there has been any significant drop.

And then Sharma nails it home:

> “It is important for Google that the ecosystem stays healthy and balanced. Without profitability, some of these players will eventually disappear and it will primarily become a Samsung + Chinese OEMs ecosystem, which is probably not what Google wants.”

Moral of the story: market share is a superficial number that doesn't tell the whole story. What's the point of gaining market share if it doesn't help your business sustain itself?
