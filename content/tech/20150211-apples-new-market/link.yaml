Body: [Ben Thompson](http://stratechery.com/2015/apples-new-market/):

> Apple is on the verge of leaving the narrowly-defined smartphone market behind entirely, instead making a play to be involved in every aspect of its consumers’ lives. And, if the importance of an integrated experience matter more with your phone than your PC, because you use it more, how much more important is an integrated experience that touches every detail of your life?

> In fact, if there is a flaw in this vision, it’s that even pulling an iPhone from your pocket is too cumbersome. What if you could interact with your home, your car, retail, the cloud, or even your own body with something even more personal and accessible?

**Phase I** — Build a killer product that people will love.

**Phase II** — Build a killer software ecosystem around it.

**Phase III** — Build a killer hardware ecosystem around it.

**Phase IV** — Build your next killer product that will eventually succeed your current killer product.
