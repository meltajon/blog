Siri is just voice recognition. But in all three cases, they grabbed a tremendous amount of mindshare in a short time.

Amen. 

Fanboys and haters like to get caught up in the 'ol "We did it first! You guys copied us!" argument. But really, that's just pointless.

It's not about who does it first; it's about who takes it to the next level.
