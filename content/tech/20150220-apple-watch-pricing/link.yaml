> Further, I don’t think any of the stainless steel bands will be available for retail purchase. They’ll sell sport bands, which you’ll be able to use on any Apple Watch, but I don’t think any of the nicer bands will be available for retail purchase. Don’t hold your breath for a space black Link Bracelet to put on your $349 Sport model. **The nicer bands aren’t accessories that Apple hopes you’ll tack onto your purchase; they’re signifiers of how much you paid for your stainless steel or gold Apple Watch**. [emphasis mine]

Agree. This reminds me of how Rolex has two bracelets for their timepieces — [Jubilee](https://www.google.com/webhp?ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#newwindow=1&q=rolex+jubilee+bracelet) and [President](https://www.google.com/webhp?ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#newwindow=1&q=rolex+president+bracelet). Because Rolexes can come in three very similar-looking metals — stainless steel, white gold, and platinum — Rolex offers the President bracelet for only white gold and platinum. So when you see a Rolex with a President band, you'll know the wearer paid for more than a stainless steel Rolex.

It's great to see a smartwatch-maker finally thinking fashion-first, not technology-first.
