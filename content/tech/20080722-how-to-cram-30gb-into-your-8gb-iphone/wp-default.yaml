Body: <p>Even though the iPhone 3G is all sorts of sexiness in a handheld device, memory is limited to 8GB and 16GB.  That's fine for people with only 8 or 16 gigabytes worth of music and videos...but what about the rest of us?  You got four options:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">

	<li>Buy a bigger iPod or mp3 player</li>

	<li>Hold out a few months for a larger iPhone</li>

	<li>Manually drag and drop songs you like, one by one, onto your iPhone</li>

	<li>Use iTunes' Smart Playlists feature</li>

</ol>

<p>I've used that latter option -- Smart Playlists -- for years, when I figured out a way to cram 24 gigs of music to a 4GB iPod mini.</p>

<p>The basic idea is this: you set conditions on what you want to hear and the Smart Playlists will automagically build itself.  For example, I may want:</p>

<p><code>R&B, at least 3 stars, that have not been played in the past week.</code></p>

<p>To do this in iTunes, just click on <code>File</code>, then <code>New Smart Playlist</code>, and then fill it out accordingly:</p>

<p><img src="http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1599/picture1dm8.png"></p>

<p>Cool, huh?  Now whenever you add music to your iTunes, as long as it matches these conditions, it will automagically get added to this Smart Playlist.</p>

<p>Here's what I did for my 4GB iPod mini back in the day:</p>

<p><code>Up to 4GB's of the most recently added songs that are rated at least 2 stars, that haven't been skipped in the last month, and haven't been played in the last week.</code></p>

<p><img src="http://img238.imageshack.us/img238/2254/picture2th6.png" /></p>

<p>If you notice, I have <code>Last Skipped</code> and <code>Last Played</code> in there.  These are what make it powerful; as I listen to music on my mini (and skip the ones I don't like), the Smart Playlist will essentially <em>learn</em> what I like/dislike and rotate in songs from my 24 GB library.</p>

<p>Easy as pie.</p>
