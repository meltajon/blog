Body: This chart by <a href="http://www.iamconcise.com/main/the-reason-for-the-ipad-mini.html" title="The Reason for iPad mini">Ryan Jones</a> is the reason why I sold my first-gen iPad yesterday.

Some people still have doubts because Steve Jobs infamously once said that 7" tablets are "dead on arrival." I, on the otherhand, am still betting on the iPad mini because of three reasons:

* this won't be the first time that Steve Jobs has backtracked on one of his bold statements.
* the iPad mini can produced cheaply by using the same touchscreen as the iPhone 3GS.
* the market and business opportunity is there. It wasn't there back then but the success of the Amazon Kindle has proven otherwise.

So I'm calling it now:

Apple is going to reassert its market dominance. It's gonna address that gaping hole under its price umbrella and be the hottest seller this Christmas shopping season. It's going to change the way an entire generation of children will learn in school.

The iPad mini is coming. It's gonna completely suck out all the air from the room and suffocate the competition, just like the iPad mini did to the mp3 player market.

I can't wait.
