> There has been a trend to either mock, or make fun of people, that want to buy products simply because a certain company makes them. Some will say this type of buyer is being guided by marketing, or is just a follower, but in reality it comes down to trust. Many people trust Apple. It is this very important connection with users that will likely get people to at least try the Apple Watch, and for Apple that is the best outcome they can wish for.

It's the same thing as fans pledging on Kickstarter for a new album by their favorite indie musician. Fans don't know exactly what they'll be getting but they *trust* it will be as good as past albums.
