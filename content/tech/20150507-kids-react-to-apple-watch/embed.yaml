Body: 

This perfectly encapsulates the entire range of first impressions that the Apple Watch is getting.

By far the most common complaint was how the Apple Watch requires an iPhone. Totally valid complaint. But once upon a time, the iPod needed a Mac. And eventually it grew into the iPhone.

Also, kudos to the kids who understand we don't *need* smartwatches, the same way we don't need a smartphone or a TV; we just *want* it the luxury because it *delights us* and *makes our lives easier*.
