> Where will the Apple Watch fit in Apple’s history? Today alone, we’ve seen predictions ranging from [“2015 is the year of the Apple Watch” and “could change the way people live”](http://qz.com/319703/2015-is-the-year-of-the-apple-watch/) to a somber prediction that it won’t be “[the homerun product that iPod, iPhone, and iPad have been](http://avc.com/2015/01/what-is-going-to-happen/).” Similar opinions have been circulating for months.

> After reading both dire and overenthusiastic predictions, as well as measuring demand several months out from the release, my belief is somewhere in the middle: the Apple Watch will do better in its first year than the first-generation Apple TV, falling somewhere between the first-generation iPhone (6.1 million units, below Apple’s target of 10 million) and the original iPad (14.8 million units, wildly surpassing most estimates). The iPhone is huge now, but it wasn’t a “gigantic hit” in its first year, while the iPad roared out of the gate and has stayed pretty strong since then. Below, I’ll explain why I think the Apple Watch will wind up between them.

I think the Apple Watch will be a slow starter for the first three years, and then catch fire in its fourth year, much like the iPhone 4.

As for the competition? They won't come anywhere close *until* they realize they have to think fashion-first like the Apple Watch, not gadget-first.
