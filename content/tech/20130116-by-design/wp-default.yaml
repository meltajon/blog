> When using a competitive product you need to use it like it was intended to be used by the designers. Don’t get the product and use the customization tools to morph it into the familiar. Even if a product has a mode to make it work like the familiar (as a competitive bridge they offer) don’t use it. Use native file formats. Use defaults in the UI and functionality. Follow the designed workflow. They key is to let loose of your muscle memory and develop new memory.

Scratch out the word "competitive" and this argument is still pure gold.

I used to be the type that would customize the hell out of my computer. Customizing, hacking, tweaking...doing everything I could just to get things exactly the way I wanted.

But over time, I'd notice that my favorite third-party hacks would get updated less and less. Next thing I know, it'd just stop working. I'd find myself completely dependent on a hack that no longer existed.

That's when I learned to stop tweaking my software and start using things as designed. 

Appreciate the design. Enjoy the reliability of a native solution. If you're gonna grow dependent on a feature, let it be a native feature that is here to stay and you know will be improved over time.

Good software is opinionated software. It should work great for people that share the same opinions as the designer.
