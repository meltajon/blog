Body: General Rules

*   Always keep one row empty to keep the screen uncluttered and give me a natural spot to swipe there when switching homescreens.

*   No bright wallpapers for the homescreen and *especially* not the lock screen. iOS keeps the lock screen at full brightness, regardless of your brightness settings. This takes a toll on the battery when push notifications come in throughout the day.

Apps

*   *Calendar* app is at the top-left and requires farthest reach for my right thumb. Its my least-used app on the homescreen, but I need it there to quickly see today's date.

*   *Maps* towards the top-right because I need them easily accessible while I'm driving. (Looking forward to the upcoming turn-by-turn feature in iOS6!)

*   *Foursquare*, *Facebook*, *PostMate* and *Tweetbot* are my most-used, most-accessible apps, placed strategically where my right thumb feels most comfortable tapping.

*   *[PostMate][1]* is an app I designed. I use it to quickly draft & post to my Twitter accounts, Facebook Profile/Pages, and Foursquare all in one shot.

*   *ProCamera* is on the dock because I take a lot of photos (of my food, lol). Its image stabilization mode is my favorite over all of the other camera apps out there.

What's Missing?

*   *Phone* — moved off-screen because I use Siri to initiate 95% of my outgoing calls and the lock screen for calling back missed calls.

*   *Weather* — moved off-screen, thanks to Siri and the Weather widget in Notification Center.

*   *Mail*, *Facebook Messenger* — I hardly initiate conversations on the iPhone so I just use Notification Center and the lock screen to stay up-to-date of new messages.

*   *Google Voice* — I have GV text messages forwarded to the Messages app; this saves me a LOT of battery compared to using the official GV app for text conversations.

*   *Reminders* - I use Siri to create tasks and location-based notifications to stay on top of them.

*   *Music* - moved off-screen because with Siri on iOS 6, I can launch this app, specific songs, and specific playlists by voice command. I mainly use this app while I'm driving anyway.

What does your homescreen look like?
