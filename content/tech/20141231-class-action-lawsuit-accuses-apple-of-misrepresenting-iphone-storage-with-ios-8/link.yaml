[AppleInsider](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/12/31/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-apple-of-misrepresenting-iphone-storage-with-ios-8):

> The complaint was filed in a California court on Tuesday on behalf of plaintiffs Paul Orshan and Christopher Endara. The suit alleges that Apple failed to disclose to consumers that as much as 23.1 percent of the advertised storage capacity of an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch would be consumed by iOS 8 once the upgrade is installed.

> The suit alleges that "reasonable consumers" would not expect such a discrepancy after updating their device to the latest operating system.

Interesting that out of all the smartphone manufacturers, Apple is the first one to get slapped with a class-action lawsuit on this. Historically, iPhones have been the most generous [compared to the competition](http://www.gottabemobile.com/2014/02/24/samsung-galaxy-s5-vs-samsung-galaxy-s4-differences/).

But looking at the big picture, actual storage capacity for all products should be clearer for all consumers, and I hope such lawsuits will improve the entire industry.
