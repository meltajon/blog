Body: Those infomercials say that the average person spends a third of their life in bed.  So why not spend the money for a really great bed?

Well, I easily spend over 13 hours of the day at the desk...so why not spend the money for a really great chair?

$1,200 is a big chunk o' change, but with a 12 year completely-covered warranty, I think it's worth it.  I mean the chair I've been sitting on is the same chair I've had since 7th grade.  If that chair could last that long, I'm sure the Aeron can too.

It's like sex.  For your ass.
