<p>Sony has announced that its <a href="http://musicstore.connect.com/" title="Sony Connect">Sony Connect Music Store</a> will be <a href="http://connect.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/connect.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=858" title='Important "Questions and Answers" regarding the closing of Sony CONNECT'>closing</a> on March 31, 2008.</p>

<p>Another one bites the dust.  And who gets bit the hardest?  The <strong>legitimate customers who paid</strong> to legitimately download music.</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>What will happen to my library (content I own)? You will continue to be able to play, manage, and transfer the music in your SonicStage library and on your ATRAC player. For music purchased via CONNECT, this means you may continue to enjoy it as usual in your current PC configuration in accordance with our terms of use.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Translation: Your Sony music will work forever...as long as you never upgrade your computer or change to a non-Sony music player.</p>

<p>Oh and btw, Sony forbids you from converting your music to another format; doing so is illegal under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA" title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> (DMCA).</p>

<p>Nice, huh?</p>
