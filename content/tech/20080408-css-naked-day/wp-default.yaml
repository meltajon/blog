<p>Don't worry, the design is stripped down just for the day.  Here's the explaination by <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/strip-down-your-blog-css-naked-day/" title="Stip Down Your Blog: CSS Naked Day">Lorelle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>This is the third year of the annual CSS Naked Day which honors web design and designers around the world who help make our websites and blogs look "pretty"¬ù to the eye while still being totally functional under the hood. Dustin Diaz wanted to give the web world an opportunity to remind everyone of the benefits of CSS web page design. By removing the stylesheet for the day, the world would see naked web pages, giving a little more appreciation for the skills of web page designers.</p>

<p>As explained yesterday in the <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2008/04/06/css-naked-day-on-april-9th-2008/" title="CSS Naked Day on April 9th, 2008">Blog Herald announcement of CSS Naked Day</a>, this is also an opportunity to showcase how <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2005/09/24/meet-them-benefits-of-compliance-with-web-standards/" title="Benefits of Compliance with Web Standards">usable and accessible</a> your web page structure is even without the pretty, reminding the world that it is the <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/02/27/website-accessibility-is-now-getting-serious-in-the-usa/" title="Website Accessibility is Now Getting Serious in the USA">law that your website must accessible</a> by everyone using any method to access your blog.

<p>Over <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/" title="Official Site for CSS Naked Day">1814 blogs</a> are participating!  (I'm #974!)</p>
