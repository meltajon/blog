Body: <a href="https://medium.com/p/6809cb0ea604">Kit Eaton</a> explains what readers often forget when reading one-sided tech news — the importance of *context*:

> The next time someone writes about Apple think about the context of why Apple is selling new iDevice X or Y, and see if that places any of the facts in the article in a different light (why did Apple chose the particular pricing it did?). The next time you read about a development of Google Glass, consider if there’s anything missing in the piece you’re reading about why Google is developing the device so oddly (why is Google missing out on cultural context by only testing it in the US?). The next time you’re reading about a new phone from Samsung, see if the writer mentions if the device has any real chance of making Samsung money or if it’s part of its usual shotgun market-coverage strategy (who is Samsung hoping to sell these phones to?). Oh, and here’s a good one about tangential context: When you next read about some new innovation or revolutionary idea, think about _how the end users will *feel* when they use it_, then see if claims of the "revolutionary" nature still apply. And so on. These are just a handful of examples. I’m sure you’ll imagine more.

Nailed it. And building on that, we as followers of tech news — or any news for that matter — need to remember this important piece of context:

Headlines are worded to be polarizing and sensationalist with the sole purpose of baiting you into clicking them. Because in today's world, more clicks means more ad impressions which means more money for the publisher.
