Body: <blockquote>

	 <p>Californians fed up with being charged for ending their cell phone service prematurely won a major victory in a Bay Area court decision that concluded such fees <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_10039461?source=most_viewed" title="Sprint early termination fees are illegal, judge rules">violate state law</a>.</p>

	<p>In a preliminary ruling Monday, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Bonnie Sabraw said Sprint Nextel must pay California mobile-phone consumers $18.2 million as part of a class-action lawsuit challenging early termination fees.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>FUCK YES.</p>

<p>This court ruling is so ridiculously huge.  Right now, carriers leverage exclusive cell phones to force you into shitty 2 year contracts.  The only good thing about it is your expensive phone will largely be paid for by the carrier.  On the other hand you're stuck with a 2 commitment.</p>

<p>You ever notice how everywhere else in the world you can get any phone, throw in a SIM card and you're good to go with any carrier?  <em>That's</em> the way it should be.  Pressure needs to be put on carriers to make their <em>service plans better</em>.  No more of this <em>baiting</em> people with sexy cell phones into a 2 year trap.</p>

<p>You want an iPhone?  Go ahead and pop in your SIM card.  Want a better plan?  Just cancel your current and sign up with someone else.</p>

<p>It <em>should</em> be that easy.</p>

	

<p>Surely this ruling will be appealed, and it's only in affect in California.  But this is just a start...hopefully it foreshadows a time when we'll see unlocked phones and real consumer choice in the US.</p>
