Body: [Non-Techie Girl #1](https://youtu.be/khRagAb_S0U?t=43s):

> That changes the game for messaging I think for really young people. And it's right on my wrist. It's so easy, I love it!

[Non-Techie Girl #2](https://youtu.be/khRagAb_S0U?t=1m30s):

> If I'm at a party and a guy is being super creepy, I could just double-tap it, that will be like, "Come save me, right now! Rescue me!"

> Girl code taken to the next level.

As [I've said before](/p/1j0p9s), I really do believe Digital Touch is an underrated feature that will become a fan favorite. Something like how front-facing cameras on phones were never considered revolutionary, yet people LOVE selfies and it's become a big part of our culture.

While I don't think people will buy an Apple Watch *for* Digital Touch, I do see people *falling in love* with it once they start using it.

And this won't be a feature that people will use with *all* their friends. Rather, it will be used with their *closest* friends, which is actually even more powerful.
