Body: This isn't exactly breaking news...but man, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8">Instapaper</a> is a REALLY GREAT app.

For months I was hesitant about forking over $5 for this app. I constantly said to myself, "I already have <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard/id358801284?mt=8">Flipboard</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-for-ipad/id375661689?mt=8">Reeder</a>...do I really need <em>another</em> reading app?"

A couple weeks ago, I said, "screw it" and finally bit the $5 bullet. 

What happened? Instapaper quickly became my most-used app on the iPad.

I should note that I am <strong>addicted</strong> to RSS feeds. As of now, I follow 528 different feeds. So anything that helps me get through those feeds faster, I immediately fall in love with. In the past, that's been Firefox's tabbed browsing, Reeder for iPad, and somewhat recently, Flipboard for iPad.

A typical morning at the desktop, I will:

<ul>

<li>load up Google Reader.</li>

<li>go up and down the list with the "j" and "k" shortcut keys.</li>

<li>when I find something I want to read, I open it as a background tab and continue skimming through Google Reader.</li>

<li>once I finish going through Google Reader, I read each one of the background tabs.</li>

</ul>

Now with Instapaper for iPad, I have a similar routine while on the go:

<ul>

<li>load up Flipboard.</li>

<li>swipe through the pages, skimming through all of my Google Reader feeds AND Twitter feed.</li>

<li>when I find something I want to read, I'll read it right away or send it to Instapaper.</li>

<li>once I finish going through Flipboard, I load up Instapaper and read each article there.</li>

</ul>

And that's not all.

In the States, I spoiled myself with 3G plans for both my iPad and iPhone. During my recent 10 week trip to the Philippines, I didn't have that luxury for either device. But that was okay because Instapaper absolutely <em>shines</em> with offline reading. 

Every time I was about to leave the house, I'd have several articles waiting for me. Hell, for my 16 hour flight back to Los Angeles, I queued up almost 100 articles. And when I came across an article that I wanted to come back to later, I'd file it under a folder like "Reblog Later", "Tweet Later" or "Watch Later".

Now that I'm back in the U.S., I really don't need to start up my iPad's 3G plan again.  With Instapaper for iPad, I can enjoy my RSS feed reading list anytime, anywhere...<em>with or without internet</em>.

So thank you, Instapaper. Before I bought you, I had no idea how important you'd be to me. I was so hesitant on spending $5 for you...but you ended up saving me $25/month.
