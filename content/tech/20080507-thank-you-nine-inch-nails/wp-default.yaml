<p>While the RIAA tells you <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071211-riaa-those-cd-rips-of-yours-are-still-unauthorized.html" title="RIAA: Those CD rips of yours are still 'unauthorized'">it's illegal</a> to rip your music CDs to your iPod, proposes a <a href="http://the577.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2394" title="$5/month Music Tax">$5/month Music Tax</a> and an <a href="http://www.melmyfinger.com/archive/2008/04/29/ipod-tax/" title="An iPod Tax?!!">iPod Tax</a>, Trent Reznor says "download it, remix it, share it, post it on your blog, play it on your podcast, give it to strangers, etc"</p>

<p>Here's what the <a href="http://theslip.nin.com/" title="Nine Inch Nails">official website</a> says:</p>

<blockquote><p>as a thank you to our fans for your continued support, we are giving away the new nine inch nails album one hundred percent free, exclusively via nin.com.</p>

<p>the music is available in a variety of formats including high-quality MP3, FLAC or M4A lossless at CD quality and even higher-than-CD quality 24/96 WAVE. your link will include all options - all free. all downloads include a PDF with artwork and credits.</p>

<p>for those of you interested in physical products, fear not. we plan to make a version of this release available on CD and vinyl in july. details coming soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not a particular fan of Nine Inch Nails, but I'm a huge fan of people that stick up for the little guy.</p>

<p>Thank you, Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails.  You guys fucking rock.  :bigthumbup:</p>
