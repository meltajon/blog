Body: The last time I <a href="/?p=273">shared my predictions</a> before an Apple event, it was mostly wildcard predictions that were dead wrong, LOL. Just for kicks, here are my Apple predictions for tomorrow (September 10th).

**Lower-Cost iPhone 5C** - 99% Confidence

Apple has its eyes on the China market. Although Apple is a premium brand that charges a premium on all their productsâ€¦China's budget-conscious market is far too important to ignore. The 5C will be plastic, come in probably 5 colors, and for the most part be what the iPhone 5 is today.

Note: This will be lower-cost but not low-cost. I say it'll start at $50 with a two-year contract.

**Goodbye iPhone 5** - 50%

This is the hardest to predict. If they keep it, should the 5C be priced higher or lower than the 5? What features would separate the 5 from the 5C? Your guess is as good as mine.

**Goodbye iPhone 4S** - 75%

Based on the blogosphere, it's a toss-up on whether the 4S, the 5, or both will be discontinued. I think Apple needs to get everyone on the new Lightning plug and the 4-inch Retina screen as soon as possible.

**Next-Gen iPhone with Fingerprint Scanner** - 99%

If this works reliably (unlike Siri), this has potential to be a real game-changer. 100% chance Apple will keep it simple for the first year and use it strictly for unlocking the lock screen. 60% chance it will be used for iCloud stuff this year.

Within two years, 60% chance Apple will get into mobile payments.

**(Limited) Offline Siri Access** - 85%

In iOS 7, Siri can be used to do simple settings like "disable WiFi" and "turn on Bluetooth". Simple Siri commands like that really shouldn't require an internet connection.

Wishlist: Siri should learn your most common commands (for me, that'd be "call Mom") and execute them instantly, without an internet connection.

**32, 64, 128GB Models** - 70%

16GB gives a terrible user experience these days, especially because popular apps like Instagram and Vine quickly eat up space. It's time to double the memory.

**Gold iPhone** - 90%

Not gold gold but champagne gold. Apparently gold is the best-selling aftermarket casing for iPhones, globally. It'll probably sell well internationally.

**Graphite iPhone** - 70%

Some recent leaks show a new graphite-gray casing for the new iPhone.

**"iPhone 6" instead "5S"** - 40%

Apple needs to drop the "S" moniker because it implies the new iPhone is only a "half-upgrade." Otherwise, Samsung will continue to (effectively) use their <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-samsung-marketing-budget-2013-6">ridiculous advertising budget</a> to tarnish the iPhone brand.

**iPhone Launch Day on Sept 20th** - 98%

AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Apple all blocking out vacation days for employees the weekend of the 20th. Can't read the tea leaves any clearer than that. 

Also, Apple typically launches the new iPhone ten days after the unveiling.

**iPhone Game Controllers** - 99%

Games for the iPhone will support a new standardized game controller. Tie this in with AirPlay + Apple TV, and you got yourself a mini game console for the living room.

**Apple TV software update** - 60%

The rumor mill is buzzing that something is coming to the Apple TV but no one is sure what. Whatever it is, if it's not unveiled tomorrow, it'll be unveiled next month.

**Larger Screen iPhone** - 0% this year (but 60% next year)

A few new behind-the-scenes things in iOS 7 totally convince me that larger iPhone is in the cards. Apparently large-screen phones sell really, really well overseas.

**iWatch** - 0% this year (but 90% next year)

So many tea leaves to read:

1) Apple has been stockpiling on <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/07/18/rumored-apple-hires-from-medical-sensor-field-could-hint-at-iwatch-capabilities">medical sensing technology</a> for a reason. 2) Apple hired the <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/08/19/apple-reportedly-hires-nike-fuelband-consultant-and-fitness-guru-jay-blahnik-for-unknown-project">fitness guru</a> behind the Nike FuelBand. 3) Tim Cook has publicly said "<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130528/tim-cook-wearable-computing-has-promise-but-must-be-compelling/">I think the wrist is interesting</a>" while sporting a Nike FuelBand. (Tim Cook is also on the board of directors at Nike.)

That's all for now. We'll see what happens tomorrow!
