> First, transit. Getting transit directions in China was far more important for Apple than getting US transit directions. Consider just a few numbers:
> 
> * The US has ten cities with a population over 1 million. China has 171.
> * The US has 34 cities with a population over 500,000.  China has 450.
> * In 2014, China had 62M vehicles of all kinds registered, in a country of 1.3 billion. This is expected to reach 200M by 2020.
> 
> Most people in China get transportation by public transit. Having a mapping service in China without transit directions would be like having one in the US without driving directions.  Apple hit this hard:
> 
> * Apple developed transit directions for just 10 cities in the non-China world, but over 300 cities in China.
> * The non-China cities for which Apple has transit directions have a combined population of about 38M. Just the 9 listed cities in China have a combined population of over 130M.
> 
> Second, improved battery life & reduced OS upgrade size. These upgrades do not exclusively benefit China, but they were important upgrades in China. In the last years, as I’ve talked with non-Apple users in China, the number one reason they bought another brand was because of screen size, which Apple solved with iPhone 6/6+. The number two reason was poor battery life. Apple getting an extra hour of battery life was important; getting 3 more hours in battery savings mode is huge for the hundreds of millions of people who commute on public transportation without a power source.
> 
> Reducing the size of the OS upgrade, likewise, is important for China and the developing world, where the phone is often the only computer. When I didn’t have enough free space to upgrade, I could just upgrade via iTunes on my Mac. For many iPhone users in China for whom iPhone is their only computer, that was never an option. There are a lot of people still on iOS 7 in China as a result

Every once in a while, Apple puts out "Snow Leopard" type releases that are primarily filled with "boring" refinements. On the surface, people can look at that as a sign that Apple no longer innovates. But really, Apple uses these "boring" OS releases to add important updates that are actually *huge* to other specific markets. 

In the past, Apple focused on features targeted at the enterprise market.

This time, with iOS 9, Apple is going all in on China.
