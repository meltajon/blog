	<span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> Apple FAIL. There's no place in the market for a $1000 iPod touch. It won't even fit in my pocket. This will be a bigger flop than the Air.

</blockquote>

I disagree.  Strongly.

<span class="comment">// Warning: This is a ridiculously long chat.  This is more to reflect on in three years time when one of us will be proven stupid.</span>

10:31:00 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> they haven't ecven announced the price yet, man<br />

10:31:05 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> where'd you get $1000 from?<br />

10:31:16 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's what people are projecting<br />

10:31:23 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> if an iPhone is $400<br />

10:31:28 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> people are dumbasses<br />

10:31:32 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> they never get the details right<br />

10:31:34 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> dude<br />

10:31:35 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> just watch<br />

10:31:45 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> even if it's $600<br />

10:31:45 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> i'm guessing<br />

10:31:52 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> $500, $600, $700<br />

10:31:52 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's just a blown up ipod touch<br />

10:32:06 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> dude, you're only thinking about now<br />

10:32:08 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> think in three years<br />

10:32:15 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the iphone went from $600 to $100<br />

10:32:20 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> in three years<br />

10:32:25 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> right<br />

10:32:29 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's not revolutionary<br />

10:32:37 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> heh, we'll see about that<br />

10:32:44 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> apple does what microsoft doesn't do:<br />

10:32:53 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> apple plans out an entire experience for the product<br />

10:32:56 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> not just the hardware<br />

10:33:00 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> they plan out the content<br />

10:33:03 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the software<br />

10:33:08 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the distribution of the content<br />

10:33:18 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> they plan out an entire vertical market<br />

10:33:28 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> so would you pay a service to have this and your iphone?<br />

10:33:35 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> when all that microsoft ever did was make the hardware and tell people, "build shit for us!"<br />

10:33:45 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> apple is proactive in getting content partners<br />

10:33:46 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you're looking at this on a micro level<br />

10:33:51 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> like a developer<br />

10:34:15 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> um no, i'm looking from a business standpoint<br />

10:34:34 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> in 6 months there will be an alternative that will do the exact same things but at a quarter of the price<br />

10:34:38 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it won't look as pretty<br />

10:34:58 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> you're not thinkinga bout the experience<br />

10:35:02 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> you're just thinking about cheaper hardware<br />

10:35:05 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> by other people<br />

10:35:10 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it wont fit in my pocket is what i'm thinking about<br />

10:35:16 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> so it's a lap top<br />

10:35:16 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's not meant to<br />

10:35:35 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's meant to chill around the house, passed around the living room<br />

10:35:38 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and thrown in your backpack<br />

10:35:41 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and taken to the office<br />

10:35:51 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> why<br />

10:35:54 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I have a computer at my office<br />

10:35:58 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's a nice mac<br />

10:36:05 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and what about nurses that have to walk around<br />

10:36:06 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and I have a nice mac laptop at my house<br />

10:36:10 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> dude<br />

10:36:13 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> doing paperwork and shit on a clipboard<br />

10:36:21 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> any business will buy the cheaper alternative<br />

10:36:21 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> also you're forgetting the educational field<br />

10:36:26 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> especially government buildings and hospitals<br />

10:36:29 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> apple is talking to all of the major textbook companies<br />

10:36:38 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> lowest bidder<br />

10:36:51 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> yes but the price of this thing will go down in three years<br />

10:37:03 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> i know how you're thought process is going,  but you'll see i'm right<br />

10:37:17 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> how much money did you spend on textbooks in college?<br />

10:37:28 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> the only thing this product will do is push other manufacturuers to give us comparable technology at more affordable prices<br />

10:37:42 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> i remember spending $500 for one quarter<br />

10:37:48 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you'll still have to license the books<br />

10:37:50 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> buddy<br />

10:38:20 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> apple is working with publishing companies to change all the old media (newspapers, magazines, textbooks) -- all three which are dying industries -- and move them into the future<br />

10:38:30 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> yeah, and that's why they're talking directly<br />

10:38:33 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> with the publishing companies<br />

10:38:47 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the same way that apple got AT&T to bend over<br />

10:38:55 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> when AT&T had never even seen the iphone<br />

10:38:57 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and now AT&T is suffering<br />

10:39:07 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and the iphone is the most successful mobile phone<br />

10:39:09 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> in the world.<br />

10:39:17 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> because as soon as teh iPhone is free for all<br />

10:39:32 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> mass migration from at&t even if they're not at fault<br />

10:39:58 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> this is not the iPhone!!!!!<br />

10:40:01 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> that's what I'm saying<br />

10:40:02 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the argument about AT&T is moot<br />

10:40:06 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> we're talking about the success of the iphone<br />

10:40:16 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and how it's the same gameplan as the success of the ipad<br />

10:40:17 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> there is no market for this particular product among the general population<br />

10:40:25 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> i agree<br />

10:40:27 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> which is why<br />

10:40:34 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> they partnered with all these companies<br />

10:40:38 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> to invent a new market<br />

10:41:17 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and what makes you think that education and hospitals will pick the iPad?<br />

10:41:34 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> would a hospital or school choose an iPhone now<br />

10:41:49 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> over a less costly alternative?<br />

10:42:01 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it will be a bidding war<br />

10:42:07 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> have you seen the business apps for the iphone?<br />

10:42:15 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> businesses are committing to it<br />

10:42:23 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> major enterprise softwware companies<br />

10:42:31 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> RIM still pwn's apple on that<br />

10:42:36 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> on business<br />

10:42:42 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and we'll see about that in 3 more years<br />

10:42:47 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> hahah<br />

10:42:52 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> yeah, we will<br />

10:42:56 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> i'ma quote this<br />

10:42:59 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and post it in my blog<br />

10:42:59 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> good<br />

10:43:03 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> this'll be fujn<br />

10:43:52 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> what's to stop a school from taking a toshiba for half the price of an iPad?<br />

10:44:13 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> because toshiba won't have the content and content distribution of apple<br />

10:44:28 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> so you're saying apple will go monoplistic?<br />

10:44:36 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> apple will dominate<br />

10:44:38 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and control content<br />

10:44:42 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> at least for 3 years<br />

10:44:48 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> dude<br />

10:44:59 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it will take longer than that to get this integrated into systems<br />

10:45:10 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> by then, there will be hundreds of cheaper alternatives<br />

10:45:16 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I dunno<br />

10:45:22 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I'm not saying I know more than apple<br />

10:45:25 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> once again, you're only thinking price of hardware<br />

10:45:31 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I think this is a risky endeavour<br />

10:45:39 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> you're not thinking of the entire experience that involves hardware, software and content<br />

10:45:45 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> yeah yeah<br />

10:45:47 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> i get that<br />

10:45:57 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> You're saying apple will partner with McGraw Hill<br />

10:46:01 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> yes<br />

10:46:04 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and say they can only licnese their books through apple store<br />

10:46:09 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> or whatever it will be<br />

10:46:10 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> for now, yes<br />

10:46:14 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> i personally ahte that<br />

10:46:15 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> but yet<br />

10:46:18 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> so<br />

10:46:19 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> *yes<br />

10:46:20 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> effectively<br />

10:46:35 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you're forcing a college student, or, heaven forbid, a hospital<br />

10:46:40 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> to buy an apple product<br />

10:46:42 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> yes<br />

10:46:43 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> because without it<br />

10:46:47 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you will not get the info you need<br />

10:46:53 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> sounds like anti-trust to me<br />

10:46:58 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> beacuse without it you will have to use shitty software and content on a cheaper system<br />

10:47:02 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> won't take long for the govt to step in<br />

10:47:38 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> because it is monopolistic<br />

10:47:42 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> because it is successful<br />

10:47:53 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> you just supported my argument<br />

10:47:54 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> haha<br />

10:48:03 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's a good idea<br />

10:48:04 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> yes<br />

10:48:06 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> but i'm saying<br />

10:48:11 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's not going to pan out the way your thinking<br />

10:49:15 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> how else will it pan out?<br />

10:49:32 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I don't think business will be so quick to jump on bored<br />

10:49:41 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> define "quick"<br />

10:49:43 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I think they'll wait and see how well it does in the market<br />

10:49:49 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> how much time is "quick"<br />

10:50:08 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> however long it takes to define whether or not the iPad is a good investment<br />

10:50:13 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> marketing plays heavily into it<br />

10:50:24 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and apple is fucking king in marketing<br />

10:50:32 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> but there is no market for this product<br />

10:50:39 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> hence they are inventing a market<br />

10:51:03 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> right, it will take a long time to prove the model is sucessful<br />

10:51:17 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> by then, a countless number of things will and can happen<br />

10:51:41 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and when you bring government operations, hospitals and schools into this?<br />

10:51:56 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I can guarantee that there will be intense scrutiny on how business is conducted<br />

10:52:07 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's a tightly regulated market<br />

10:52:20 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> if what you're saying is true<br />

10:52:33 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and that it's more than just a private toy<br />

10:52:38 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's a huge risk<br />

10:52:46 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I'm not saying it wont work, but it's a huge risk<br />

10:53:02 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and that's why apple is taking steps to make their software optimized for enterprise<br />

10:53:04 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I personally don't think it will work<br />

10:53:18 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I could be wrong, but it's not like this is going to sink apple<br />

10:53:18 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> just like with the iphone, they introduced built-in support of Microsoft Exchange<br />

10:53:28 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and they offer remote security features<br />

10:53:43 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> oh<br />

10:53:47 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> i can also say<br />

10:53:51 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> why not make another iphone<br />

10:53:59 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> with all that licensing and garbage youre saying<br />

10:54:10 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you don't think in 3 years, the iPhone will be able to handle everything you're talking about?<br />

10:54:40 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> what if we don't even have to have screens in 5 years, what if we have holograpic techology like the movies?<br />

10:54:57 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> all these what ifs<br />

10:55:07 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> the way this conference is going, looks to me like its a toy for people at home<br />

10:55:09 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the iphone is purely limited on size<br />

10:55:26 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> of course it'll be much better, stronger, faster in three years<br />

10:55:33 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> but they're fixed on that form factor<br />

10:55:36 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> not true<br />

10:55:46 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> these flex screens coming out now<br />

10:55:53 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> wrap around your wrist, etc.<br />

10:55:57 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> *size of screens<br />

10:55:58 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> why not make a foldable iphone<br />

10:56:10 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's not impossible<br />

10:56:19 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and i'm sure apple is already looking into that<br />

10:56:23 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> just as the iphone was a 6 year project<br />

10:56:24 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> right<br />

10:56:30 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> there is no market for this<br />

10:56:33 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> is what im saying<br />

10:56:35 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and this tablet is 20 years in the making<br />

10:56:46 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> right, and i'm saying apple is inventing a new market<br />

10:56:53 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's like the Air<br />

10:56:54 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's for show<br />

10:57:09 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> um no, the air is just dumb because it's ridiculously expensive<br />

10:57:17 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the air's only niche is<br />

10:57:29 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> rich fucks that want a travel-light secondary computer<br />

10:57:33 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's not meant to be a primary computer<br />

10:57:38 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's an apple netbook, if you will<br />

10:57:40 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's just dumb because<br />

10:57:43 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's retardly expensive<br />

10:58:03 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> so you're saying what will make the difference here is the intro price?<br />

10:58:10 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> of this pad<br />

10:58:26 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> what will make the difference?<br />

10:58:35 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> nothing<br />

10:58:37 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> its fate is sealed<br />

10:58:39 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> haha<br />

10:58:42 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it will fail<br />

10:58:50 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it may break even<br />

10:58:55 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it may start a revolution<br />

10:59:00 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> but the iPad is destined to fail<br />

10:59:08 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> this is coming from a 25 year old advertiser...<br />

10:59:23 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> so take it however you want<br />

10:59:27 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> but, all im hearing<br />

10:59:29 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> from everyone around me<br />

10:59:36 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> is that it doesn't make sense<br />

10:59:44 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's a giant iPod<br />

10:59:51 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and it's not worth picking up<br />

10:59:51 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> yes, it is<br />

10:59:54 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> a giant ipod<br />

11:00:06 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> with ebook functionality, media functionality<br />

11:00:09 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> gaming functionality<br />

11:00:27 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> gaming and e-publishing are the biggest points about this device<br />

11:00:29 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> over the iphone<br />

11:00:42 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and then the enterprise software<br />

11:00:48 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> dude<br />

11:00:51 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> one point is all i have<br />

11:00:52 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> which we'll be seeing in a year or so<br />

11:00:59 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> i'm going to end on this<br />

11:01:04 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> the world runs on Microsoft<br />

11:01:08 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and for a reason<br />

11:01:15 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> apple has always been about the consumer<br />

11:01:17 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> not about businesses<br />

11:01:25 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you're telling me that they're changing their business model entirely<br />

11:01:28 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and that's something they've realized and they're changing<br />

11:01:35 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I don't buy it<br />

11:01:37 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> not for a second<br />

11:01:38 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> no, their business model has always been the same:<br />

11:02:06 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> make money on premium prized hardware, and invent content, software and content distribution to facilitate purchasing of the hardware<br />

11:02:10 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> *priced<br />

11:02:11 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> dude<br />

11:02:20 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> apple barely breaks even on selling music<br />

11:02:25 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> same with apps<br />

11:02:33 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> they make all their money selling expensive ass hardware<br />

11:02:53 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> but they use amazing software adn content partnerships as their killer advantage<br />

11:03:11 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> they will not be able to effectively monopolize content, especially information<br />

11:03:19 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it will never happen<br />

11:03:23 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> unless they move to China<br />

11:03:23 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> ia gree<br />

11:03:30 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> same way they don't monopolize music<br />

11:03:39 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> but they dominate in the hardware category<br />

11:03:47 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> sure, people have hundreds of ways to get music<br />

11:03:51 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> but<br />

11:03:52 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> fiiine<br />

11:03:54 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the iphone and ipod dominate<br />

11:03:58 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> no<br />

11:04:07 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> itunes dominates<br />

11:04:11 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and I can have that on any platform I wish<br />

11:04:40 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> haha, this is an entirely different discussion<br />

11:04:55 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I like how you're a brand ambassador for apple<br />

11:05:02 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> in my opinion<br />

11:05:06 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> i think this product<br />

11:05:06 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10417825-37.html<br />

11:05:09 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> this one we're looking at<br />

11:05:13 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> http://www.tuaw.com/2009/10/28/apple-iphone-closing-in-on-blackberry-market-share/<br />

11:05:14 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> will not be sucessful<br />

11:05:30 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> help me interpret those numbers then<br />

11:05:32 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> that is my point<br />

11:05:47 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> your point that apple is closing in on blackberry?<br />

11:06:01 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> hold on, work<br />

11:10:39 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> that's not a projection<br />

11:10:44 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> that's historical<br />

11:10:58 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> trend, yes, apple is catching up<br />

11:11:08 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> what makes you think the iPad will effect these numbers?<br />

11:11:29 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> apple is inventing a new market, so it won't matter for at least a year<br />

11:11:34 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and yes a 10% share is pretty dominant<br />

11:11:35 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it'll be it's own chart<br />

11:11:54 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> this "new market" of yours...<br />

11:12:02 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> when I see it, then we'll have the discussion<br />

11:12:17 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> as of now, we're looking at a very expensive toy that doesn't have a home<br />

11:13:04 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> are they rolling out this new market now as well?<br />

11:13:59 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> yes, new market was invented today<br />

11:14:09 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's not meant to be a phone<br />

11:14:11 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> or a computer<br />

11:14:14 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's a tablet device<br />

11:14:54 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's a new category<br />

11:15:05 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> (actually, it's an old old category but this is the re-invention of it)<br />

11:19:25 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> $499<br />

11:19:29 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> my friend<br />

11:19:42 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> http://c0581892.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/apple-tablet-keynote_177.jpg<br />

11:25:01 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> yeah<br />

11:25:03 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> without 3G<br />

11:25:09 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> so it's a giant iPod<br />

11:25:12 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> again<br />

11:25:18 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> and again, that price will go down<br />

11:25:29 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's $700 for everything you need<br />

11:25:32 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> including the service<br />

11:25:39 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> if it's for businesses, they won't need 3G<br />

11:25:41 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> just wifi<br />

11:25:47 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> are you going to get one?<br />

11:25:53 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> not even the live blog people are impressed<br />

11:25:53 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> i'll wait for 128GB<br />

11:26:02 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> yeah, 16gb?<br />

11:26:07 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> right now it'll be early adopters taht'll jump on this<br />

11:26:09 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> just like the iphone<br />

11:26:11 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> my phone has more than that<br />

11:26:18 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> but once it gets cheaper, it'll be legit mainstream<br />

11:26:28 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> yeah, if it gets to about $200<br />

11:26:30 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> I'd get one<br />

11:26:32 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> early adopters are willing to throw down $600 for a 8GB iphone when it came out<br />

11:26:43 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> early adopters don't care about price<br />

11:26:44 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> iphone was revolutionary<br />

11:26:44 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> this<br />

11:26:46 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> not so much<br />

11:26:50 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> nothing "magical" about it<br />

11:26:58 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's a big ass iPod<br />

11:27:04 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> i agree<br />

11:27:10 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> but it comes down to the experience<br />

11:27:13 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> of the software and teh content<br />

11:27:16 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> oh god<br />

11:27:17 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> here we go<br />

11:27:32 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> experience the 7 inch screen<br />

11:27:33 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> that's it<br />

11:27:37 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> <---- i'm a software designer.  user experience matters<br />

11:27:50 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> it's not just about what a device can do, it's also about how easy it is to do it<br />

11:27:50 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> well<br />

11:27:57 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> we'll be able to tell in a few months if you are right<br />

11:28:04 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> because if it doesn't sell well<br />

11:28:05 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> the iphone was a smartphone and smartphones have been around since the mid 90s<br />

11:28:05 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> they'll kill it<br />

11:28:25 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> and I just don't see smart people spending money on it<br />

11:28:32 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> but when the price goes down<br />

11:28:33 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> then what?<br />

11:28:39 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> dude<br />

11:28:46 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> haha<br />

11:28:48 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> actually<br />

11:28:50 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> i was just oging to say<br />

11:28:55 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> think of the R&D they have to make up<br />

11:28:57 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> then I just realized<br />

11:29:04 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's a big iPod...probably not much R&D<br />

11:29:22 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> they invest a shit-ton in R&D<br />

11:29:30 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> right, so if it doesn't sell<br />

11:29:33 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you kill it<br />

11:29:37 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> watch, they're gonna put in RFID in these devices soon<br />

11:29:40 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> that's a game changer<br />

11:29:47 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you lower the price to get rid of the shit that never sold to recoup some costs<br />

11:30:08 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> umm no, they use the R&D to provide the highest bang for your buck<br />

11:30:15 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> so they can pass the price savings to the consumer<br />

11:30:17 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> yeah, I said<br />

11:30:19 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> if the product fails<br />

11:30:29 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> you sell it off to recoup costs<br />

11:30:53 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> there is no price savings to the consumer when it comes to apple<br />

11:31:01 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> it's high-end and it likes being there<br />

11:32:01 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> with 3G this thing is a big iPhone<br />

11:32:10 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> only my iPhone can sometimes make calls<br />

11:32:24 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> sometimes<br />

11:32:40 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> for the amount of press it's getting, I hope it does well<br />

11:32:52 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> we'll see in six months what unfolds<br />

11:32:56 <span style="color: blue;">Josh S:</span> should be interesting<br />

11:34:20 <span style="color: red;">Mel:</span> yep, will be interesting<br />
