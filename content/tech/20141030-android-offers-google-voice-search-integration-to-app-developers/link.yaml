> One of the arguably best features of Android is getting friendly with third-party apps. Simply by adding a few lines of code, Android apps can take advantage of the “OK Google” voice command that’s become prevalent on Android devices and Android Wear smartwatches. Once apps are updated, users can use specific apps in their voice commands. For example, you could speak “Ok Google, search for hotels in Maui on TripAdvisor” to have the voice search use the TripAdvisor app instead of returning a generic Google search, boosting app engagement. Google says the new support is only available on English locale devices running Android Jelly Bean or higher.

This is a big deal for the future of mobile, wearable devices, and any non-traditional computing device that will be connected to the internet.

I've been hoping Apple would offer this with Siri 2.0 but Google is the only company in the world that can truly pioneer this right now.
