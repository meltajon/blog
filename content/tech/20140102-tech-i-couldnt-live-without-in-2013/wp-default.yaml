Body: As part of <a href="/?p=404">my annual tradition</a>, here is a list of my favorite apps, services, and tech products that I used throughout 2013.

## Still Going Strong

**Mac mini with 1TB Fusion Drive** — For a $1,100 Mac that's over a year old, this baby is still FAST.

I've been using Bitcasa for over a year, but one night I randomly saw an error for a LOT of failed uploads. All of these uploads were initiated several months prior, which basically meant that data has been lost. Because of that, I learned it's smarter to *sync* local files to the cloud instead of solely hosting on the cloud. 

My Mac mini's 1TB gives me plenty of room to keep a local copy of everything I digitally own.

**iPhone** — Last year I said this about my 4S and it still rings true:

> My iPhone is my communications hub where all of my notifications are pushed to. And the outstanding 8 megapixel camera lets me capture precious moments that I want to carry with me for the rest of my life.

The biggest upgrade for me in the 5s is the new Burst Mode. I've spent a LOT of money on camera apps, trying to find the perfect implementation of image stabilization. But now with with the 5s' 10 shots/second built in — for the first time ever — I only use the default camera app. I LOVE how the Photos app will highlight the best shot from the burst for you.

**Google** — Gmail is still king of email. Chrome has the right balance of feature robustness and simplicity. Google Voice is my primary number and is slowly being integrated into Google Hangouts.

**Tweetbot for Mac/iOS** — Ever since <a href="/?p=466">my experiment</a> of dumping all tech news RSS feeds in favor of a curating my own Twitter List, Tweetbot's placement syncing has been VITAL to me. Following tech news as a Twitter stream instead of an RSS inbox has saved me a lot of time and redundancy.

**Instapaper for Mac/iOS/Android** — This is the second key component of my tech-news-as-a-stream strategy. Any links on Tweetbot that catch my eye get saved to Instapaper to read later.

**Instagram** — Last year I wrote this:

> If I had to give up all social networks except one, I would keep Instagram. It's by far the most personal social network out there because everyone post things that make them _happy_, unlike Twitter/Facebook where some people only use for passive-aggression, bitching and whining.

Instagram Videos added a fun dimension.

Instagram Direct is a very welcome addition too. Not all my friends have Snapchat and Google Voice still doesn't really support MMS.

**Facebook** — All of my friends are still on it. Most of my friends don't have Twitter so Facebook is still the best way for me to reach everyone in my life.

**Dropbox** — Been a loyal user since 2006 because it's the easiest way to share large files. Also, I trust Dropbox's reliability enough to host 1Password, which manages all of my passwords.

**Backblaze** — Honestly, I forget that I still have this installed but once in a while, online backups save my ass.

## New for 2013

**ReadKit for Mac** — As the final piece of my tech-news-as-a-stream strategy, I use this app to breeze through my tech news reading list that I've Instapaper'ed from Tweetbot throughout the day.

**Two-Step Authentication** — For all of the pillars of my digital life (e.g. Gmail, Dropbox, Dreamhost, Facebook, Twitter), I've enabled two-step authentication. These accounts are gateways to all other services I use, therefore they need the highest protection.

**Authy for iOS/Android** — Authy frees me to do two-step authentication from any of my three mobile devices.

**1Password for Mac/iOS** — Over the course of two years, I've put more and more trust into using 1Password to manage all my accounts. I now fully trust it with *all* of my passwords.

**Feedly for Mac/iOS/Android** — Google Reader died this year and I started using Twitter for tech news. Still, I use RSS readers to follow the not-so-urgent blogs that I love.

**Forklift for Mac** — This year I learned that Forklift has a feature that lets you sync two folders. Total game changer for me as a web developer.

**Day One for Mac/iOS** — I used to have all of my journal entries posted on a private Wordpress blog but I've found a lot of convenience in using Day One's iPhone app and the Mac menu bar widget. Journal entries don't have to be so formal; many times all I need is 140-characters.

**Apple Time Capsule** — I've always resisted this in the past because I thought backing up gigs of data over WiFi would be a slow and shitty experience. I was wrong. Backups happen so silently and transparently, I forget it's even there.

**GitHub** — For the first few years of my career, I've worked at agencies that had me pump out websites as fast as possible. Now that I'm an in-house web developer, I need version control for my on-going projects.

**Circa for iOS/Android** — As a tech news junkie, following news can get overwhelming. This year I took a step back and realized that I really need to pay attention to what else is going on in the world. Circa makes it easy by presenting world news in bite-sized pieces and giving me the option to follow for real-time updates.

**Simplenote for Mac/iOS/Android** — Super simple note-taking app with cross-platform syncing. And best of all, it's FREE.

## Honorable Mentions

**Snapchat** — It's a fun way to send inside-jokes as picture messages to specific friends (that are not necessarily in the same circle).

**Foursquare** — Truthfully, the social aspect of Foursquare doesn't appeal to me as much anymore. But I still find value in keeping tabs of where I go and where I want to go.

**Imgur.com** — Tumblr used to be a very important source of entertainment for me but I figured out that 90% of viral posts on Tumblr come from Imgur. Now I just go straight to the source for good laughs.

**Gemini for Mac** — As a digital hoarder, I've accumulated a ton of duplicate photos, videos, and zip files over the years. Gemini made it SUPER EASY to find and purge duplicate files.

## Keeping an Eye Out for 2014

**Google Hangouts** — This thing is gonna be so awesome when they integrate Google Voice into it. I envision it as becoming iMessage but for Gmail/Google Voice users. Only half of my friends are iPhone users…but almost all of them are Gmail users.

**Fitness Tracking Apps** — A nifty little feature of the iPhone 5s is it's motion-tracking M7 chip. The Nike+ Move app keeps tabs on my movement and actually has gotten me to be more active.

## Not as Cool as Before

**iPad mini** — Honestly, my use of the iPad mini is waning just a bit. I no longer bring the iPad mini with me to lunch to catch up on Instapaper; I do most of my Instapaper reading on my Mac now.

These days, my iPad mini usage breaks down to something like: 90% video watching, 5% mobile web development, 5% gaming. For the most part, my iPad mini is always next to my Mac.

I could see myself giving up my iPad mini in favor of a larger iPhone, if Apple were ever to release one.

**Flipboard** — Once my killer app, Flipboard has lost a lot of it's value to me because it no longer integrates with any third-part RSS readers.

**Skype** — My social circles don't use Skype that much anymore.

**Pinterest** — I'm not much of a scrapbooker.

**Voxer** — Not many friends use this anymore.

## Dismissed

**App.Net** — Everyone that I care to follow in tech is still active on Twitter.

**Tumblr** — Dumped in favor of Imgur.

**New Myspace** — lol.

**ProCamera for iOS** — Dumped in favor of the 5s' built-in Burst Mode.

**Bitcasa** — I lost some data because their app corrupted some of my files before uploading. That shit is unforgivable.

**Drafts App for iOS** — Dumped in favor of Simplenote.

**Pinboard** — Dumped in favor of ReadKit.
