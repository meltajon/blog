> "Why do I need a laptop? If I really need to get some work done, Iâ€™ll just go back to my desk."

> "Why do I need a cell phone? I already am paying for phones at home and work, and I can use a payphone in a pinch."

> "Why do I need a smartphone? I have a cell phone, and I can grab my laptop if I want to get on the web."

> "Why do I need a tablet? I have a laptop."

Typical responses by mainstream consumers whenever an innovative new technology is on the horizon.
