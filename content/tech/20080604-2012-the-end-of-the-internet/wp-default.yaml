<p>As Josh <a href="http://the577.com/forums/showthread.php?p=5995#post5995" title="40GB for $55/month: Time Warner Bandwith Caps Arrive">pointed out</a> the other day, Time Warner is launching a test program where they will throttle down people's internet, enforce a bandwidth cap, and charge for overrages.</p>

<p>What does this mean to you?</p>

<p>This means that ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are planning on controlling what you can and cannot do on the internet.  This means that they can choose what sites you can and cannot visit.  This means they want to kill the fastest, greatest, most democratic form of communication the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>And this isn't the first time in history we've seen this happen.</p>

<p>When radio first came out, anyone and everyone be their own radio station.  They could broadcast freely, speak their mind and do whatever the hell they want.  Freedom of speech at its finest.</p>

<p>And then the FCC came along and said, "Alright, no more pirate radio.  If you want a radio station, you have to pay us a shitload of cash."  So what happened?  All of the fun, off-the-wall, liberal-minded radio stations were shut out.</p>

<p>The same exact thing happened with television.  Look at it now...the media controls the information that the public consumes.</p>

<p>FOX Television have a problem with Ron Paul?  No problem!  They just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCAYRWIcPKQ" title="Ron Paul Fox Covers Fox Censorship New Hampshire Forum Jan 6">cut him out from debates</a> and downplay anything significant he does.</p>

<p>George W. Bush wants to <a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/2-bush-moves-toward-martial-law/" title="Bush Moves Toward Martial Law">impose Martial Law</a>?  No problem!  Just don't mention it in the news.</p>

<p>Does Ron Paul really know what he's talking about?  Does Bush really want to impose Martial Law?  Maybe, maybe not...but either way, <em>we don't get to decide for ourselves</em> because the media controls <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/080117mediacensorship" title="Top Censored Media Stories of 2007">what we see and hear</a>.</p>

<p>So back to Time Warner...let's say that this Time Warner experiment is profitable.  If other ISPs buy into it, the internet you know and love today could become like cable television:</p>

<p>Facebook and Google?  No problem!  Just pay for the basic internet package and you're good.</p>

<p>Little sites like <a href="http://the577.com">the577.com</a> and <a href="http://www.melmyfinger.com">www.melmyfinger.com</a>?  Sorry but by <a href="http://ipower.ning.com/netneutrality" title="2012: The Year the Internet Ends">2012</a>, you might have to pay a premium to keep enjoying 'em...</p>
