This, ladies and gentlemen, is why the iPad will be a game-changer.

The experience of flipping through a magazine is like having a entire website -- and not just any site but a beautiful, graphically-rich, totally interactive site -- in your hands.  With ZERO downloading.

These days if you want to do research on something, you'll be clicking around, waiting for the page to load, clicking around, waiting for the page to load...etc.  Rinse and repeat.  But with entire book/magazine publications download in full, onto one device...you can experience the same thing with <em>zero loading time</em> between pages!

And it's not just magazines we're talking about.  Imagine textbooks for colleges.  Imagine being able to zoom in on a 3D model of a string of DNA.  Move it around 360 degrees.  Get a real good look at it and then zoom out.  All of this and more, in your hands, with zero loading time.

You have kids?  Just fire up an interactive book and let 'em knock themselves out.  I know what you're thinking: why would I give my kid a $500 toy??  Just search up "baby games" for iPhone...you'll be surprised how popular the iPhone/iTouch is for kids.

Honestly, after watching this video, I'm really jealous of programmers and interactive designers now.  Because this new concept of rich, truly-interactive digital pages is gonna be a LOT of fun...and it's the way of the future.
