Body: This week's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/15/11-questions-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask-about-net-neutrality/">court ruling</a> was a HUGE blow to the internet as we know it. The common consumer has no idea what this means but they will when they start to see things like this.

You don't think this is a big deal? Just look at how US news networks <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/03/american-networks-egypt-coverage_n_3536826.html">deemphasize news</a> that they don't care about. Just look at how much carriers <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/mobile/141867-price-gouging-it-costs-more-to-send-a-text-message-on-earth-than-from-mars">overcharge for texting</a>.

Information is power and now internet providers have the ability to control the flow of information as they say fit.
