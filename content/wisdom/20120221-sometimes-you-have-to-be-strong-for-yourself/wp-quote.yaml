Body: Sometimes you have to be strong for yourself.

You have to know that you're a good person and a good friend. What's meant to be will end up good and what's not - won't. 

Love is worth fighting for, but sometimes you can't be the only one fighting. 

At times, people need to fight for you. If they don't, you just have to move on and realize what you gave them was more than they were willing to give you. 

Hopefully, people realize great things when they come around and not lose something real. 

Always fight, until you can't anymore, and then be fought for.
