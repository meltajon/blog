Body: Happiness is a journey, not a destination. For a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin -- real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. 

At last it dawned on me that these obstacles <em>were</em> my life. This perspective has helped me to see there is no way to happiness. 

Happiness <em>is</em> the way. 

So treasure every moment you have and remember that time waits for no one.
