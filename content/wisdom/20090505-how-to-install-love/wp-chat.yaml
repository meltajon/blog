Body: <span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> Hello "¦ how can I help you? <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Well, after much consideration, I've decided to install Love. Can you guide me through the process? <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> Yes. I can help you. Are you ready to proceed?  <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Well, I'm not very technical, but I think I'm ready. What do I do first? <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> The first step is to open your Heart. Have you located your Heart?  <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Yes, but there are several other programs running now. Is it okay to install Love while they are running? <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> What programs are running ? <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Let's see, I have Past Hurt, Low Self-Esteem, Grudge and Resentment running right now.  <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> No problem, Love will gradually erase Past Hurt from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory but it will no longer disrupt other programs. Love will eventually override Low Self-Esteem with a module of its own called High Self-Esteem. However, you have to completely turn off Grudge and Resentment. Those programs prevent Love from being properly installed. Can you turn those off ?  <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how?  <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> With pleasure. Go to your start menu and invoke Forgiveness. Do this as many times as necessary until Grudge and Resentment have been completely erased. <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Okay, done! Love has started installing itself. Is that normal? <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other Hearts in order to get the upgrades. <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Oops! I have an error message already. It says, "Error - Program not run on external components." What should I do?  <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> Don't worry. It means that the Love program is set up to run on Internal Hearts, but has not yet been run on your Heart. In non-technical terms, it simply means you have to Love yourself before you can Love others. <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> So, what should I do? <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> Pull down Self-Acceptance; then click on the following files: Forgive-Self; Realize Your Worth; and Acknowledge your Limitations.  <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Okay, done. <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> Now, copy them to the "My Heart" directory. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching faulty programming. Also, you need to delete Verbose Self-Criticism from all directories and empty your Recycle Bin to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back. <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Got it. Hey! My heart is filling up with new files. Smile is playing on my monitor and Peace and Contentment are copying themselves all over My Heart. Is this normal? <br />

<span style="color: blue;">Tech Support:</span> Sometimes. For others it takes awhile, but eventually everything gets it at the proper time. So Love is installed and running. One more thing before we hang up. Love is Freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everyone you meet. They will in turn share it with others and return some cool modules back to you.  <br />

<span style="color:red;">Customer:</span> Thank you, God.
