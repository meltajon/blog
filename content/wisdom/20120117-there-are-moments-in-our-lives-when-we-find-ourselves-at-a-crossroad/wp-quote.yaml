Body: 

There are moments in our lives when we find ourselves at a crossroad. Afraid, confused, without a road map.

The choices we make in those moments can define the rest of our days. Of course, when faced with the unknown, most of us prefer to turn around and go back.

But once in a while, people push on to something better.

Something found just beyond the pain of going it alone, and just beyond the bravery and courage it takes to let someone in, or to give someone a second chance.

Something beyond the quiet persistence of a dream.

Because it's only when you're tested that you truly discover who you are. And it's only when you're tested that you discover who you can be.

The person you want to be does exist, somewhere on the other side of hard work and faith and belief. And beyond heartache and fear of what lies ahead.
