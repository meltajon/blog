Body: It's okay to want someone you can't have. It's okay to keep friendships when you don't want them, or want something more. It's okay to cry when you're hurt and it's okay to stay mad at someone who hurt you.

Believe it or not, it's always going to be okay.

That's just how it works. Sometimes, things don't always work out the way you want them to, and a lot of times, it seems like they never will, but its okay. That's how life's supposed to go.

It's all about learning how to deal with the bumpy parts in the road and waiting till they're smooth again. It's all about forgiving and forgetting. It's all about waiting and wishing.

That's just how life is.
