AFTER A WHILE"¦. you learn the subtle differences between touching a life, and changing a soul; You learn the subtle differences between holding a hand, and letting one go; You learn the subtle differences between failure and downfall; You learn the subtle differences between disappointment and regret; You learn the subtle differences between having faith and finding hope.

AND YOU LEARN"¦You learn that love doesn't mean certainty and success doesn't mean security; You learn that promises aren't perpetual and words aren't eternal; You learn that kisses aren't assurrances, and hugs aren't compromises; You learn that even sunshine burns if you ask for too much. So you begin to accept your defeats. With your head held high and your eyes straight ahead, you keep on going.

AND YOU LEARN"¦You learn to build your loads on today because tomorrow's grounds are too uncertain. So you plant your own garden and decorate your own life. You sing your own song and lighten your own soul. You write your own novel instead of waiting for someone else to write if for you. You smile; you dance; you laugh; you celebrate and you love. And you learn that you really can endure. That you really are strong.

And you learn"¦and you learn. With every accomplishment, failure, triumph and defeat"¦you learn.
