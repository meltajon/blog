Title: "Sometimes people say things they don't mean or do things they can't take back.  Sometimes we do things we can't take back.  What I have done is who I am.  But what I have done is not who I will be.  Unburden yourself from the mistakes of the past.  And when you do your heart grows stronger."

Body: Sometimes people say things they don't mean or do things they can't take back.  Sometimes we do things we can't take back.  What I have done is who I am.  But what I have done is not who I will be.  Unburden yourself from the mistakes of the past.  And when you do your heart grows stronger.
