Body: 

Tree Hill is just a place somewhere in the world. Maybe it’s a lot like your world, maybe it’s nothing like it. 

But if you look closer, you might see someone like you. Someone trying to find their way. Someone trying to find their place. Someone trying to find their self. 

Sometimes it seems like you are the only one in the world who’s struggling, who’s frustrated, unsatisfied, barely getting by.

But that feeling’s a lie. And if you just hold on, just find the courage to face it all for another day, someone or something will find you and make it all okay.

Because we all need a little help sometimes – someone to help us hear the music in their world, to remind us that it won’t always be this way.

That someone is out there. And that someone will find you.
