Body: A beautiful girl can make you dizzy, like you've been drinking Jack and Coke all morning. She can make you feel high, full of the greatest comidy known to man: PROMISE. Promise of a better day, promise of a new tommrow, this particular aura can be found in the gate of a beautiful girl. In her smile, in her soul, in the way she makes every rotten thing in this life seem like it's going to be okay.
