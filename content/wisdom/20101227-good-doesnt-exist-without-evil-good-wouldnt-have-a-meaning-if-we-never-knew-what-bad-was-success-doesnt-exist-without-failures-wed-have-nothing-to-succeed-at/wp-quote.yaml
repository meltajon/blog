Title: "Good doesn't exist without evil. Good wouldn't have a meaning, if we never knew what bad was. Success doesn't exist without failures. We'd have nothing to succeed at, if we didn't fail at anything. Love doesn't exist without struggle. There would be no reason to love, if we didn't struggle so much for how much it was worth it in the end."

Body: Good doesn't exist without evil. Good wouldn't have a meaning, if we never knew what bad was. Success doesn't exist without failures. We'd have nothing to succeed at, if we didn't fail at anything. Love doesn't exist without struggle. There would be no reason to love, if we didn't struggle so much for how much it was worth it in the end.
