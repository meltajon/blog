Body: I understand that DEEP DOWN most of us want to become BETTER.

We want to be able to OPEN UP and experience REAL LOVE.

MANY OF US WISH WE COULD TRUST OTHERS.

BUT WE'VE BEEN HURT

By a father who wasn't there.

By a mother who never seemed to be satisfied with our choices.

By family who criticized our every move with disapproval.

By a close friend who betrayed our trust.

EVEN WORSE WERE THOSE DAYS WHEN WE REALLY NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO... And all our friends were NOWHERE to be found. (DESPITE the fact that we were always there for them)

* * *

SO WE PUT ON MASKS and create these characters that aren't us.

We do it because we're AFRAID that if people saw how we really were,

they might NOT want to be around us anymore...

So we hide our brokenness... our deep dark secrets.

Our painful past. We lie about our scars and mistakes.

We do it because

We want to feel loved and appreciated. USEFUL. Needed. Beautiful.



But we never mention

the EMPTINESS DEEP inside that haunts us EVERYWHERE we go.

An emptiness that we try to fill with acquaintances, temporary highs,

hobbies, and romantic relationships. SEX, DRUGS, & COCOA PUFFS.

Don't get me wrong,

There are days where the emptiness DOES go away.

But it ALWAYS comes back. And what sucks most is that

YOU CAN BE SURROUNDED BY ALL YOUR FRIENDS,

AND STILL FEEL BROKEN AND LONELY INSIDE.

* * *

If there is ONE thing

you need to remember from this whole blog, it is this:

THE ONLY THING BIG ENOUGH TO QUENCH THE EMPTINESS

INSIDE OF YOU, IS GOD. Everything else is just too small.

* * *

SO my friends,

as you allow God to fill the areas of your life plagued with loneliness,

be sure to remember the wonderful words of MARK TWAIN

"DANCE LIKE NOBODY'S WATCHING;

LOVE LIKE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HURT.

SING LIKE NOBODY'S LISTENING;

LIVE LIKE IT'S HEAVEN ON EARTH."
