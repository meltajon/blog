Albert Camus once wrote, "Blessed are the hearts that can bend; they shall never be broken."

But I wonder? If there's no breaking, then there's no healing. And if there's no healing, then there's no learning. And if there's no learning, then there's no struggle.

But struggle is a part of life. So must all hearts be broken.
