Title: "Pain doesn't tell you when you ought to stop.  Pain is the little voice in your head that tries to hold you back because it knows if you continue, you will change.  Don't let it stop you from being who you can be.  Exhaustion tells you when you ought to stop.  You only reach your limit when you can go no further.

Don't let it stop you from being who you can be.  Exhaustion tells you when you ought to stop.  You only reach your limit when you can go no further.
