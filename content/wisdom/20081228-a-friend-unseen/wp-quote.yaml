Body: It's strange to have a friend

that you have never hugged

lightly touched their arm

or looked into their eyes.

But you have

touched their soul

felt their heart

been embraced by

the warmth of their being.

A friend unseen

is not a friend untouched.

The eyes of the soul will gaze

the heart will embrace

the image will stand tall

but only in a dream.
