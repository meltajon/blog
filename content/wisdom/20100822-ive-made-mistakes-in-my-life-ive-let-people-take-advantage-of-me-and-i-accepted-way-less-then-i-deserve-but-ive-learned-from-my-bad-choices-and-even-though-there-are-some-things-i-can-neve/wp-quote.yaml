Title: "I've made mistakes in my life. I've let people take advantage of me, and I accepted way less then I deserve. But, I've learned from my bad choices and even though there are some things I can never get back and people who will never be sorry, I'll know better next time and I won't settle for anything less then I deserve."

But, I've learned from my bad choices and even though there are some things I can never get back and people who will never be sorry, I'll know better next time and I won't settle for anything less then I deserve.
