Body: Spend time with nice people who are smart, driven and likeminded. Relationships should help you, not hurt you. Surround yourself with people who reflect the person you want to be.

Choose friends who you are proud to know, people you admire, who love and respect you — people who make your day a little brighter simply by being in it.

Life is too short to spend time with people who suck the happiness out of you. When you free yourself from negative people, you free yourself to be *you* — and being you is the only way to truly live.
