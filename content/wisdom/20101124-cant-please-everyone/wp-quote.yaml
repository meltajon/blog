Body: You don't have time to convince everybody to like you. Your time is too great to fight battles that don't matter. If someone doesn't praise you, they don't matter. If someone leaves you, you didn't need them. I love loyal people, I love the ones that I know will accept me through every decision I make. When you realize that you can't please everybody, you're going to see new seasons of growth, new opportunities, and God will take you to new places that you've never even dreamed of. Your destiny is too great to be wasted on other people who won't accept you.
