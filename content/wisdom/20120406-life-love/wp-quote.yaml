Body: Life is the process of finding love; every person will need to find four people in their life.

The first person is you; the second person is the one you love most, the third person is the one who love you most, and the fourth is the one you spend the rest of your life with.

First in life, you will meet with the one whom you love most, and learn how love feels. You will learn how love feels, so you can find the person who loves you the most. When you have experienced the feeling of loving others and being loved, you will then know what it is you need most. Then you will find the person who is most suitable for you, to be able to spend the rest of your life with.

Sadly, in real life, these three people are usually not the same person.

The one you love most doesn't love you. The one who loves you most is never the one you love most. And the one you spend your life with is never the one you love most or the one who loves you most. She is just the person who happens to be at the right place at the right time.

Which person are you in other people's life?

No person will purposely have a change of heart. At that point in time, when she loves you, she really loves you. But when she doesn't love you anymore,she really doesn't love you anymore. When she loves you, she can't pretend that he doesn't. Same goes, when she loves you no longer, there's no way she can pretend she loves you.

When a person doesn't love you and wants to leave you, you must ask yourself if you still love her. If it so happens that you don't love her anymore, do not keep her just to save your pride. If you still love her, you should wish her happiness and hope that she will be with the one she loves most, not stop her from it. If you stop her from finding true happiness with the one she loves, it shows you already don't love her, And if you don't love her, what rights do you have to blame her for a change of heart?

Love is not possessive. If you like the moon, you can't just take it down and put it in your room. But the moonlight still shines upon you. In other words, when you love a person, you can use another method of possessing the person. Let her become a permanent memory in you life. If you really love a person, you must love her for what she is. Love her for her good points, and the bad. You can't wish for her to become what you like her to be just because you love her.

When you really love a person, you cannot find a reason why you love her. You only know that no matter when and where, good mood or bad mood, you will wish to have this person be with you. Real love is when two people can go through the toughest problems without asking for promises or listing criterias. In a relationship, you have to put in effort and give in at times, not always be on the receiving end. Being away from each other is a type of test; if the relationship isn't strong, then you can only admit defeat. Real love will never become hate.

When two people are in love, they love to ask each other to swear, to make promises. Why do they ask each other to swear and promise? Because they don't trust each other, they don't trust their lover. These swears and promises are useless. Till the sky falls, till the ocean dries, my love for you will never change. We all know that the sky will never fall and that the ocean will never dry. And if it does happen, will we even be alive?
